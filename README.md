# Linear control system design
 Course at Chalmers

---
## Overview of core content

It is a detailed course about Linear control theory, and it is the fomentation of other control courses.

The key part of this course I think is the design of LQR controller and the design of the observer, those two repeatedly appear in my later courses.

## Pity

The textbook sucks (And happy to hear the Prof plans to change to a new textbook 2024)

And in my experience, the LQR controller part of this course is unclear. I have to search on the internet for my information and finally understand it in the Helicopter lab.

If you are studying at Chalmers, I recommend this video for LQR:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEevt2a4SKI&list=PLxdnSsBqCrrF9KOQRB9ByfB0EUMwnLO9o&index=29

## Warning

If you plagiarize, you will gain nothing and only face judgment in an academic court.
